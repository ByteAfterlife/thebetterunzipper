# The Better Unzipper
## What makes it so good?

The better unzipper is a basic unzipper.. but with some more advanced features. Go to <a href="#features">Features</a> for a list.

## Features
- Delete original zip file (optional) at the end
- When you extract a zip file to a folder, do you ever open it to realize, you got another folder to go into, then have to move it to your desktop.. it automatically does that for you.
- If the previous feature doesn't apply, it automatically creates a new directory in your chosen one with the zip file's name (without the .zip file extension).
- Terminal based extraction stats updating in realtime.
- Command line argument possible for zip files (check how to specify command line zip file)
## Terminal stats include:
- ETA for completion
- Name of file currently being extracted
- Progress bar using = symbols
- Speed of extraction
## How to specify a zip file as a command argument?
When using the python script (not the exe) do `python thebetterunzipper.py (zip file, e.g. mycool.zip)<br>
When using the exe, open your terminal and type thebetterunzipper.exe (zip file, e.g. mycool.zip)
## Pros vs. Cons
### Pros
- It's solved quite a few of common issues when extracting zip files.
- Has a user friendly to use GUI and Command line interface.
- Open Source
- Simple stats of whats going on at the moment
### Cons
- Might be a little bit slower than some extractors.
- Windows only
- Zip files only, no tar.gz or rar or whatever other archive files you can think of, its better unZIPper.
- This is a simple project, so it may not be maintained that much


## Note
This is just a fun project I decided to do, this is not real software I recommend to use for some important thing, this is (probably) very bad code, I'm not responsible for whatever happens to your zip file. If it's something worth keeping, please back it up. I hope nothing bad happens to your data, but I don't know.
